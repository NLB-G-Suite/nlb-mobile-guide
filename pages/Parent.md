<h2>More Tips</h2>
<button class="accordion">It’s great that I can sign my child up to be an NLB member online! How do I do that?</button>

<div class="panel">
  <div class="libby">
    <p>You can sign your child up <a href="https://account.nlb.gov.sg">online</a> using your SingPass if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your child is a Singaporean or Permanent Resident, and</li>
<li>Your child is born in Singapore</li>
</ul>
<p>Do note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your child is a PR and a student at a MOE school, he/she is eligible for a waiver on the one-time registration fee. To receive the waiver, sign up for library membership at the libraries instead of online.
<ul>
<li>If you have more than one child, you can choose to register just one child or all your children at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></div>

<button class="accordion1">What do I need to sign up for library membership online?</button>

<div class="panel">
    <div class="libby">
  <p>You will need a:</p>
<ul>
<li>SingPass login ID and password</li>
<li>[For PRs] Debit/credit card to pay the one-time registration fee of $10.50</li>
      </ul></div>
</div>

<button class="accordion">eBooks with narration sounds interesting. How do I search for these books?</button>

<div class="panel">
  <div class="libby">
  <p>In the Libby app, tap on Library -> Explore -> Guide: Kids and scroll down until you see 'I Can Read! Series Read-Alongs' and 'Read-Alongs'.</p></div>
</div>

<button class="accordion1">I noticed that you offer a few types of interactive eBooks. What is the difference between the eBooks with narration in Libby (“Read-alongs”) and the animated picture books in Tumblebook Library?</button>

<div class="panel">
  <div class="libby">
      <p>Both types of interactive eBooks feature professionally-recorded narration that play along while you read. The animated picture books in Tumblebook Library are fully-animated videos whilst the 'Read-alongs' in Libby are more like eBooks with the words highlighted as they are read.</p>
