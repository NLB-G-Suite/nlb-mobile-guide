			Tap on 'Library' in the Libby app, located at the bottom left corner of your screen,  and scroll down to browse book lists by category,  e.g. thrillers or what’s trending. Just tap on the theme you’re in the mood for and let Libby lead you to your next great read!

        <div class="acc-body">
			How about eAudiobooks? You can listen to them while doing chores, driving –even right before bed as part of your wind-down routine. Some of these books are read by famous authors themselves, especially autobiographies such as Becoming by Michelle Obama. To check if the book you want has an audiobook version, simply search for the title. The word “audiobook” will appear underneath your search term if available.

			<br>If you just want to explore what is available, tap on 'Library' in the Libby app and select 'Available Audiobooks'. If you listen before bedtime, Libby can automatically pause the narration after a specific amount of time set by you. Open the audiobook and tap, hold and drag down the moon icon to set the sleep timer.
			<br>Short stories are also a great way to squeeze in some reading. To find them, go to Library -> Explore -> Subjects -> Short Stories. Some of these are also available as eAudiobooks!
