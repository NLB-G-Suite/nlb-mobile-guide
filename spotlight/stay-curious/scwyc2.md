<h4>Tip for parents:</h4>
When kids are active, their bodies can do the things they want and need them to do. Why? Because regular exercise provides these benefits:

<ul>
<li>strong muscles and bones</li>
<li>healthy weight</li>
<li>decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>better sleep</li>
<li>a better outlook on life</li>
</ul>
<p>Physically active kids also are more likely to be motivated, focused, and successful in school. And mastering physical skills builds confidence at every age.</p>
