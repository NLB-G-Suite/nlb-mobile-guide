        <label for="acc2">When I open the PressReader app, I see a box that says ‘Sponsored Access’. What does 'Sponsored Access' mean?</label>

 <div class="acc-body">
  <p>‘Sponsored Access’ means that you have been granted complimentary access to PressReader. During this period, you can download PressReader content and continue to read the downloaded content until you decide to delete the files.</p> 
<p>‘Sponsored Access’ is granted when you access PressReader via the NLB Mobile app, or when you connect your device to Wireless@SG/SGx at the libraries.

		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc3">
        <label for="acc3">How do I get complimentary access (also known as ‘Sponsored Access’) to PressReader?</label>
<div class="acc-body">
    <p>There are many ways! If you are reading from your mobile device, the best way is through the NLB Mobile app. If you are reading from your computer or laptop, use your Internet browser. If you want to read local newspapers too, you have to access PressReader at our libraries.</p>
<p>Here are the details of each access mode:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>NLB Mobile app</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Tap the &ldquo;eNewspapers &amp; eMagazines&rdquo; icon on your NLB Mobile app. You will be prompted to download the PressReader app if you don&rsquo;t have it. When you launch the PressReader app through NLB Mobile, you can get one hour of complimentary access to the publications. When the hour is up, you can re-launch PressReader from NLB Mobile to get complimentary access again.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li><strong>Internet browser</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Go to NLB&rsquo;s <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/Browse/resource/1323">eResources webpage on PressReader</a>. Sign in with your myLibrary ID, and click on &ldquo;PressReader&rdquo; to gain complimentary access to the publications.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li><strong>NLB libraries</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li>Connect <strong>your device</strong> to the Wireless@SG/SGx network at our libraries. Open either <a href="http://www.pressreader.com">pressreader.com</a> in your browser or the PressReader app. You will have complimentary access to PressReader&rsquo;s publications for three days, even after you leave the library. However, access to <em>The Straits Times</em>, <em>The Business Times</em> and <em>Lianhe Zaobao</em> is only available while you are connected to the Wireless@SG/SGx network at any library.</li>
	<li>Use the <strong>eNewspaper stations</strong> at our libraries.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc4">
        <label for="acc4">How do I confirm if I have connected to PressReader and can enjoy complimentary content?</label>

<div class="acc-body">
  <p>To confirm this, go to the &lsquo;Browse&rsquo; tab in the PressReader app and look for a tea cup icon at the bottom right corner of the display. This tea cup icon will appear when you are connected to PressReader through the Wireless@SG/SGx network at NLB libraries, or via the NLB Mobile app.</p>
