        <label for="acc2">When I open the PressReader app, I see a box that says ‘Sponsored Access’. What does 'Sponsored Access' mean?</label>

 <div class="acc-body">
  <p>‘Sponsored Access’ means that you have been granted complimentary access to PressReader. This allows you to download PressReader content for an extended period even after leaving the library premises. You can continue to read the content that you have downloaded on the mobile app until you decide to delete the files.</p> 
<p>‘Sponsored Access’ is granted when you connect your device to Wireless@SG/SGx at the libraries via the PressReader app, or online at PressReader.com.

        <label for="acc3">How do I get complimentary access (also known as ‘Sponsored Access’) to PressReader?</label>
<div class="acc-body">
    <p>There are many ways to get complimentary access to the publications in PressReader. If you are reading from your mobile device, the best way is through the NLB Mobile app. If you are reading from your computer or laptop, use your Internet browser. If you want to read local newspapers too, you have to access PressReader at our libraries.</p>
<p>Here are the details of each access mode:</p>
<ol>
<li>NLB Mobile app
<ol>
<li>Tap the &ldquo;eNewspapers &amp; eMagazines&rdquo; icon on your NLB Mobile app. You will be prompted to download the PressReader app if you don&rsquo;t have it. When you launch the PressReader app through NLB Mobile, you can get one hour of complimentary access to the publications. When the hour is up, you can re-launch PressReader from NLB Mobile to get complimentary access again.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Internet browser
<ol>
<li>Go to NLB&rsquo;s <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/Browse/resource/1323">eResources webpage on PressReader</a>. Sign in with your myLibrary ID, and click on &ldquo;PressReader&rdquo; to gain complimentary access to the publications.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>NLB libraries
<ol>
<li>Connect your device to the Wireless@SG/SGx network at our libraries, and open either <a href="http://www.pressreader.com">pressreader.com</a> in your browser or the PressReader app. You will have complimentary access to PressReader&rsquo;s publications for three days, even after you leave the library. However, do note that access to <em>The Straits Times</em>, <em>The Business Times</em> and <em>Lianhe Zaobao</em> is only available while you are connected to the Wireless@SG/SGx network at any library.</li>
<li>You can also use the eNewspaper stations at our libraries.</li>

		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc7">
        <label for="acc7">Can I read local newspapers published by Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) such as <i>The Straits Times, Business Times</i> and <i>Lianhe Zaobao</i> on PressReader?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>Yes, you can. Do note that you can read SPH newspapers only <u>onsite</u> at NLB&rsquo;s libraries via:</p>
<ul>
<li>The libraries&rsquo; computers
<ul>
<li>eNewspaper Stations</li>
<li>Multimedia stations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your device, <u>only</u> while it is connected to NLB's Wireless@SG/SGx networks
<ul>
<li>PressReader app (Android, iOS and Windows)</li>
<li>NLB Mobile app via the eNewspapers &amp; eMagazines icon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SPH newspapers are not available <u>outside of NLB library premises</u> in Singapore due to the geographic restriction set by the publisher.</p>
        <p>You can download as many SPH newspapers as you want when you are at the libraries just as long as your device has enough storage for the downloaded content. You can then continue to read the downloaded content even when you are away from the library premises.</p>
