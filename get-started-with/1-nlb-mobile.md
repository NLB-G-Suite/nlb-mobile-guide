Do note that this sponsored access is for one hour only. Don’t worry, when the one hour is up, you can re-launch PressReader from NLB Mobile to get sponsored access again. </p>
<p>In addition, local newspapers such as<em> The Straits Times, The Business Times</em> and <em>Lianhe Zaobao</em> can only be accessed when your device is connected to the Wireless@SG/SGx network at any library.</p>
