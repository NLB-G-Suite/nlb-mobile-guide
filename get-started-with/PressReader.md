 <p>NLB Mobile, OverDrive and Libby are apps that let you borrow and read NLB’s
eBooks/audiobooks. NLB’s eBooks/audiobooks are hosted on third-party platforms such
as OverDrive.
<p>
<b>NLB Mobile</b> is an NLB app designed for access and transactions. It lets you borrow and
read eBooks online, but does not have an in-built eBook reader to read a downloaded
eBook. Additionally, it lets you access eMagazines / eNewspapers, eLearning courses,
and check your library account.</p>
<p>
<b>OverDrive </b> lets you borrow and download eBooks/audiobooks from the library. You
can use the in-app features to read downloaded eBooks and listen to downloaded
audiobooks.</p>
<p><b>Libby</b> is a new app by OverDrive. It also lets you borrow and download eBooks/
audiobooks, but with a simpler user interface.</p>
