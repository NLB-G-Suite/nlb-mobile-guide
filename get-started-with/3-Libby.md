        <label for="acc2">What is the difference between Libby and NLB Mobile?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>NLB Mobile and Libby are apps that let you borrow and read NLB's eBooks and audiobooks.</p>
<p><strong>NLB Mobile</strong> lets you easily check your account and access our resources. You can borrow eBooks / Audiobooks, access eNewspapers / eMagazines and online courses. </p><p>While NLB Mobile lets you read or listen to eBooks / Audiobooks while you are connected to the Internet, it does not have an in-built reader for you to read downloaded eBooks.</p>
<p><strong>Libby </strong>is a third-party app by OverDrive. You can borrow and download NLB's eBooks / Audiobooks, so that you can enjoy them even when you are offline. <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/6103.htm?tocpath=Home%7CGetting%20started%7C_____2">Watch a short introduction video on how to set up Libby</a>.</p>

		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc4">
		<label for="acc4">I tried to 'Add A Library Card' and was prompted to enter a 'user ID' when entering my 'Library Account Details'. What is my 'user ID'? </label>
<div class="acc-body">
  <p>Your 'user ID' refers to your NLB myLibrary ID. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
        <input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc5">
        <label for="acc5">Can I use more than one library card or cards from different libraries in Libby?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
		<p>Yes, you can! </p>
		<p>Libby makes it easy to switch between library cards or between different libraries (e.g. for users who are not only members of NLB but also members of school libraries that use the OverDrive platform). Open the menu, select ‘See Library Cards’ or ‘Add A Library’. </p><p>All your digital checkouts from different cards and libraries are on the same virtual shelf, so you need not switch between libraries or cards to read your books.</p>

        <div class="acc-body">
    	  <p>If the title you wish to borrow is not available, you can reserve it free of charge by selecting the "Place Hold" option in Libby.  You can reserve up to 16 eBooks / audiobooks. </p>
      <p>To ensure that titles are delivered at the right time for you, reserved items <b>will not be automatically borrowed</b>. We will notify you via email or the Libby app when your reservation is ready. To keep the reservation, simply respond to the notification within 10 days.</p>     
<p>You will have three options:</p>  
<ul>
<li>borrow now,</li>
<li>deliver later, which lets you stay next in line for up to 180 days, or</li>
<li>cancel the reservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions have to be taken through:</p>  
<ul>
<li>Libby app or <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb" target="_blank">libbyapp.com/library/nlb</a></li>
<li>OverDrive app or <a href="https://nlb.overdrive.com" target="_blank">nlb.overdrive.com</a></li>
    </ul>
<p>If you don't respond within 10 days, we get it, you're busy - your reservation will be cancelled.</p>


<p>To check your notification settings in Libby, please read <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/6174.htm" target="_blank">this Help article</a> on setting up and managing notifications. </p>

                <div class="acc-body">
<p>Go to your Shelf in Libby and look at the icon next to the book title. If there is a tick next to the title, it's been downloaded on your device for offline use.</p>
<p>If there's a cloud icon next to the title, it hasn't been downloaded on your device. It'll be streamed when you open it, requires an internet connection to read or listen to, and doesn't take up space on your device.</p>

        <label for="acc7b">Do the eMagazines add to my eBook loan quota?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
		<p>
		Good news! Magazines don't affect your eBook loan quota. What's more, you can borrow unlimited magazines. We also have unlimited <b>copies</b> of every magazine - so you never need to wait for your turn to borrow.

        <label for="acc7c">What's the difference between Libby and PressReader?</label>
	<div class="acc-body">
		    <p>
		    The difference between PressReader and Libby is that Libby has a smaller, <b>magazines-only</b> collection, but includes some that are not available in PressReader. These are:</p>
		    <ol>
			<li>Allure</li>
			<li>Billboard</li>
			<li>Bon Appetit</li>
			<li>Conde Nast Traveler</li>
			<li>Marie Claire</li>
			<li>Rolling Stone</li>
			<li>The Economist</li>
			<li>The Hollywood Reporter</li>
			<li>The New Yorker</li>
			<li>Wired</li>
		    </ol>
		    <p>
		    If the above titles aren't what you are looking for, try PressReader for a wider selection that includes newspapers too. <a href="/get-started-with/pressreader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here</a> for the PressReader guide.
		    </p>
		<p>
		    The other key difference is that once downloaded, you get to keep PressReader magazines in your device for as long as you want. Libby Magazines are automatically returned after 21 days. After that, feel free to borrow again if you still want them.

        <div class="acc-body">
      <p>If you are using Libby across multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, Libby automatically syncs your loans, holds and book progress between devices. Just ensure that your library cards are on each device, and you are connected to the Internet. To manually sync your Shelf, go to Shelf &gt; Actions. Select 'Synchronise Shelf'.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using NLB Mobile and Libby across multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the loans and holds will be synced across these apps.</li>
<li>Bookmarks from NLB Mobile will not be seen in Libby and vice versa. In NLB Mobile, 'bookmarks' mark your favorite books and eBooks in NLB so that you can search them more easily. In Libby, 'bookmarks' mark pages within your eBook to help you find your way around the eBook.</li>

        <div class="acc-body">
<p>Format availability for eBooks is subject to the negotiations between OverDrive and the respective companies, e.g. Amazon. NLB will purchase eBooks in the best formats that are available in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kindle</strong>: Currently, Kindle is not supported.</p>
		<p><strong>Kobo</strong>: Yes, you can access NLB's eBooks <b>directly</b>, if you have any of the following models:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kobo Libra H2O,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Forma,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Aura ONE,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Aura Edition 2,</li>
  <li>Aura H2O Edition 2, or&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Clara HD devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Log in with your myLibrary ID via the OverDrive integration under Settings &gt; &nbsp;OverDrive on these Kobo devices to read NLB's eBooks. Titles do not need to be available in Kobo format to be downloaded on a Kobo device. However, only NLB eBooks which are found in the Kobo store can be borrowed directly from these Kobo devices. 
  <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/2194.htm" target="_blank">Read this article</a> for a step-by-step guide on how to borrow OverDrive ebooks on your Kobo device.
</p>
<p>For older models of Kobo eReaders such as those below, you will need to transfer NLB's eBooks from a computer using the free Adobe Digital Editions software:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kobo Aura</li>
  <li>Touch 2.0</li>
  <li>Glo</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the steps to do so:</p>
<p>i. Connect your eReader to your computer</p>
<p>ii. Install and authorise Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) on your computer</p>
<p>iii. Download an EPUB or PDF eBook to ADE from your library’s digital collection. Downloaded eBooks should open automatically in ADE.</p>
<p>iv. In ADE, make sure you’re in the “Library” view. Your eReader should show up under “Devices”. You may need to accept a file-transfer prompt in your eReader in order to appear in ADE.</p>
<p>v. If your eReader is not detected by ADE, you might have to update to the most recent version of ADE. For more information, read this article on 
  <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0047.html" target="_blank">what to do if your eReader is not detected by ADE</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Nook</strong>: NLB currently does not purchase and support eBooks in the Nook format as it is not officially available to the Singapore market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apple Books</strong>: Currently, Apple Books is not supported.</p>
<p><strong>Google Play Books</strong>: Currently, Google Play Books is not supported.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Digital Editions</strong>: Yes, you can. Read this article on
