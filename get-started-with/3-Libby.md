		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc5"><!--question 1-->
        <label for="acc5">What is the difference between Libby and NLB Mobile?</label>
        <div class="acc-body"><!--answer for question 1-->
  <p>NLB Mobile and Libby are apps that let you borrow and read NLB's eBooks and eAudiobooks.</p>
<p><strong>NLB Mobile</strong> lets you easily check your account and access our resources. You can borrow eBooks / eAudiobooks, access eNewspapers / eMagazines and online courses. </p><p>While NLB Mobile lets you read or listen to eBooks / eAudiobooks while you are connected to the Internet, it does not have an in-built reader for you to read downloaded eBooks.</p>
<p><strong>Libby </strong>is a third-party app by OverDrive. You can borrow and download NLB's eBooks / eAudiobooks, so that you can enjoy them even when you are offline. <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/6103.htm?tocpath=Home%7CGetting%20started%7C_____2">Watch a short introduction video on how to set up Libby</a>.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started with Libby</h2>
<div class="acc-kontainer">          
	<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc1">
		<label for="acc1">I tried to 'Add A Library Card' and was prompted to enter a 'User ID' when entering my 'Library Account Details'. What is my User ID? </label>


<div class="acc-body">
  <p>Your 'User ID' refers to your NLB myLibrary ID. </p>
</div>
</div>

 <div>
        <input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc2">
        <label for="acc2">Can I use more than one library card or cards from different libraries in Libby?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
		<p>Yes, you can! </p>
		<p>Libby makes it easy to switch between library cards or between different libraries (e.g. for users who are not only members of NLB but also members of school libraries that use the OverDrive platform). Open the menu, select ‘See Library Cards’ or ‘Add A Library’. </p><p>All your digital checkouts from different cards and libraries are on the same virtual shelf, so you need not switch between libraries or cards to read your books.</p>
</div></div>
 <div>
        <input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc19">
        <label for="acc19">There are no more copies available for the title I want. Can I reserve it for free? How do I know when it is my turn to borrow it?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
		  <p>If the title you wish to borrow is not available, you can reserve it free of charge by selecting the "Place Hold" option in Libby.  You can reserve up to 16 eBooks / eAudiobooks. </p>
      <p>To ensure that titles are delivered at the right time for you, reserved items <b>will not be automatically borrowed</b>. We will notify you via email or the Libby app when it's your turn. To keep the reservation, simply respond to the notification within 10 days.</p>     
<p>You will have three options:</p>  
<ul>
<li>borrow now,</li>
<li>deliver later, which lets you stay next in line for up to 180 days, or</li>
<li>cancel the reservation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions have to be taken through:</p>  
<ul>
<li>Libby app or <a href="https://libbyapp.com/library/nlb">libbyapp.com/library/nlb</a></li>
<li>OverDrive app or <a href="https://nlb.overdrive.com">nlb.overdrive.com</a></li>
    </ul>
<p>If you don't respond within 10 days, we get it, you're busy - your reservation will be cancelled.</p>


<p>To check your notification settings in Libby, please read <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/6174.htm">this Help article</a> on setting up and managing notifications. </p>

  <h2>Different Devices</h2>

        <label for="acc4">Will my loans, holds and book progress (e.g. bookmarks) be synced across multiple devices and apps?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
      <p>If you are using Libby across multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, Libby automatically syncs your loans, holds and book progress between devices. Just ensure that your library cards are on each device, and you are connected to the Internet. To manually sync your Shelf, go to Shelf &gt; Actions. Select 'Synchronise Shelf'.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using NLB Mobile and Libby across multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the loans and holds will be synced across these apps.</li>
<li>Bookmarks from NLB Mobile will not be seen in Libby and vice versa. In NLB Mobile, 'bookmarks' mark your favorite books and eBooks in NLB so that you can search them more easily. In Libby, 'bookmarks' mark pages within your eBook to help you find your way around the eBook.</li>

        <label for="acc6">Why does NLB Mobile ask me to install Libby when I choose to download an eBook / eAudiobook?</label>

  <h2>Compatibility with eReaders / apps</h2>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc9">
        <label for="acc9">Can I read NLB's eBooks using eReaders (e.g. Kindle, Kobo, Nook) or apps (e.g. Apple Books, Google Play Books, Adobe Digital Editions)?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
<p>Format availability for eBooks is subject to the negotiations between OverDrive and the respective companies, e.g. Amazon. NLB will purchase eBooks in the best formats that are available in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kindle</strong>: Currently, Kindle is not supported.</p>
		<p><strong>Kobo</strong>: Yes, you can access NLB's eBooks <b>directly</b>, if you have any of the following models:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kobo Libra H2O,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Forma,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Aura ONE,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Aura Edition 2,</li>
  <li>Aura H2O Edition 2, or&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Clara HD devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Log in with your myLibrary ID via the OverDrive integration under Settings &gt; &nbsp;OverDrive on these Kobo devices to read NLB's eBooks. Titles do not need to be available in Kobo format to be downloaded on a Kobo device. However, only NLB eBooks which are found in the Kobo store can be borrowed directly from these Kobo devices. 
  <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/2194.htm">Read this article</a> for a step-by-step guide on how to borrow OverDrive ebooks on your Kobo device.
</p>
<p>For older models of Kobo eReaders such as those below, you will need to transfer NLB's eBooks from a computer using the free Adobe Digital Editions software:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kobo Aura</li>
  <li>Touch 2.0</li>
  <li>Glo</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the steps to do so:</p>
<p>i. Connect your eReader to your computer</p>
<p>ii. Install and authorise Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) on your computer</p>
<p>iii. Download an EPUB or PDF eBook to ADE from your library’s digital collection. Downloaded eBooks should open automatically in ADE.</p>
<p>iv. In ADE, make sure you’re in the “Library” view. Your eReader should show up under “Devices”. You may need to accept a file-transfer prompt in your eReader in order to appear in ADE.</p>
<p>v. If your eReader is not detected by ADE, you might have to update to the most recent version of ADE. For more information, read this article on 
  <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0047.html">what to do if your eReader is not detected by ADE</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Nook</strong>: NLB currently does not purchase and support eBooks in the Nook format as it is not officially available to the Singapore market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apple Books</strong>: Currently, Apple Books is not supported.</p>
<p><strong>Google Play Books</strong>: Currently, Google Play Books is not supported.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Digital Editions</strong>: Yes, you can. Read this article on
