<button class="accordion">What is the difference between NLB Mobile, OverDrive app and Libby?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <div class="panel-text">
  <p>NLB Mobile, OverDrive and Libby are apps that let you borrow and read NLB's eBooks / eAudiobooks. They are hosted on third-party platforms such as OverDrive.</p>
<p><strong>NLB Mobile</strong> is an NLB app designed for access and transactions. It lets you borrow and read or listen to eBooks / eAudiobooks online, but does not have an in-built reader for downloaded eBooks / eAudiobooks. Additionally, it lets you access eNewspapers / eMagazines as well as online courses, and check your library account.</p>
<p><strong>OverDrive </strong>lets you borrow and download eBooks / eAudiobooks from the library. You can use the in-app features to read downloaded eBooks and listen to eAudiobooks.</p>
<p><strong>Libby </strong>is a new app by OverDrive. It also lets you borrow and download eBooks / eAudiobooks, but with a simpler user interface.</p>

<button class="accordion">What’s the point of Libby when there is an existing OverDrive app?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <div class="panel-text">
  <p>Both Libby and the OverDrive app allow you to borrow eBooks and eAudiobooks. Libby has a simpler user experience, and is thus the recommended choice for first-time users.

<button class="accordion">Is Libby replacing the OverDrive app?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <div class="panel-text">
    <p>Libby will not be replacing the OverDrive app. OverDrive has no plans to remove the OverDrive app. NLB will keep users updated on the latest developments from OverDrive, if any.

<button class="accordion">Can I use Libby or OverDrive on Kindle, Kobo or Nook e-Readers?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <div class="panel-text">
  <p>NLB currently does not purchase and support eBooks in Kindle, Kobo or Nook formats as they are not officially available to the Singapore market.</p> 
  <p>Format availability for eBooks is subject to the negotiations between OverDrive and the eReader companies, e.g. Amazon. NLB will purchase eBooks in the best formats that are available in Singapore.</p>
<p>Hence, Libby and OverDrive are not supported on such eReaders in Singapore for now.</p>

<button class="accordion">Can I read in landscape mode on my phone using Libby?</button>

<div class="panel">
  <div class="panel-text">
  <p>For regular eBooks in Libby, OverDrive has not settled on a landscape reading experience on small screens that meet their standard. These books are always presented in portrait mode on small screens. For picture books, landscape mode is usually available regardless of screen size.</p>

<button class="accordion">I checked out a book using the OverDrive app or using the OverDrive website on my computer, and now I can’t return it early on Libby.</button>

<div class="panel">
  <div class="panel-text">
      <p>eBooks added to the Libby app are in the <i>OverDrive Read</i> or <i>OverDrive Listen</i> formats. If you download a book in EPUB format or an audiobook in MP3 format on the OverDrive app (where the title is not offered in the <i>OverDrive Read</i> or <i>OverDrive Listen</i> formats), it will not display in Libby and cannot be returned early via the Libby app.</p> 
      <p>With the exception of <i>OverDrive Read</i> or <i>OverDrive Listen</i> formats, titles you download can be returned early from the device you downloaded them to, or on the OverDrive website. All titles expire automatically after the loan period.

<button class="accordion">Can I use more than one library card or cards from different libraries in Libby?</button>

<div class="panel">
  <div class="panel-text">
  <p>Yes, you can! Libby makes it easy to switch between library cards or between different libraries (for e.g. for users who are not only members of NLB but also members of school libraries that use the OverDrive platform). Open the menu, then select ‘See Library Cards’ or ‘Add A Library’. All your digital checkouts from different cards and libraries are on the same virtual shelf, so there is no need to switch between libraries or cards to read your books.</p>

<button class="accordion1">I tried to 'Add A Library Card' and was prompted to enter a 'User ID' when entering my 'Library Account Details'. What is my User ID'? </button>

<div class="panel">
  <div class="panel-text">
  <p>Your 'User ID' refers to your NLB myLibrary ID. </p>

  <p>There is currently no limit to the number of devices that you can use to sign in to Libby.</p>

<button class="accordion">Will my loans, holds and book progress (e.g. bookmarks) be synced across multiple devices and apps?</button>

<div class="panel">
  <div class="panel-text">
      <p>If you are using Libby across multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libby automatically syncs your loans, holds and book progress between devices, as long as you have an internet connection and your library cards are on each device. To manually sync your Shelf, go to Shelf &gt; Actions. Select 'Synchronise Shelf'.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using NLB Mobile and Libby across multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the loans and holds will be synced across these apps.</li>
<li>Bookmarks from NLB Mobile will not be seen in Libby as they are actually different features on NLB Mobile and Libby. 'Bookmarks' on NLB Mobile refer to bookmarks of favourite physical and digital items, while 'Bookmarks' on Libby refer to the bookmarking of pages or timestamps within the digital items.</li>
</ul>
