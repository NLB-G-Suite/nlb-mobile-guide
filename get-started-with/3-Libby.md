title: Reading eBooks and eAudiobooks
---

<p>Our eBook and eAudiobook collection allows you to read or learn anytime, anywhere. There are two apps that let you access the entire library from your smartphone. The <a href="/get-started-with/nlb-mobile/">NLB Mobile app</a> allows you to read or listen to eBooks / eAudiobooks online. To download eBooks / eAudiobooks so that you can enjoy them even without an internet connection, use the Libby app.</p>
<p>Download the Libby app from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/libby-by-overdrive/id1076402606">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overdrive.mobile.android.libby">Google Play</a> now.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started with Libby</h2>

	<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc1"><!--question 1-->
		<label for="acc1">I tried to 'Add A Library Card' and was prompted to enter a 'User ID' when entering my 'Library Account Details'. What is my User ID'? </label>

<div class="acc-body"><!--answer for question 1-->
  <p>Your 'User ID' refers to your NLB myLibrary ID. </p>

 <div>
        <input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc2">
        <label for="acc2">Can I use more than one library card or cards from different libraries in Libby?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>Yes, you can! Libby makes it easy to switch between library cards or between different libraries (e.g. for users who are not only members of NLB but also members of school libraries that use the OverDrive platform). Open the menu, then select ‘See Library Cards’ or ‘Add A Library’. All your digital checkouts from different cards and libraries are on the same virtual shelf, so there is no need to switch between libraries or cards to read your books.</p>
</div></div>

  <h2>Different Devices</h2>
 <div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc3">
        <label for="acc3">Is there a device limit for Libby?</label>
        
        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>There is currently no limit to the number of devices that you can use to sign in to Libby.</p>

</div></div>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc4">
        <label for="acc4">Will my loans, holds and book progress (e.g. bookmarks) be synced across multiple devices and apps?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
      <p>If you are using Libby across multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libby automatically syncs your loans, holds and book progress between devices, as long as you have an internet connection and your library cards are on each device. To manually sync your Shelf, go to Shelf &gt; Actions. Select 'Synchronise Shelf'.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using NLB Mobile and Libby across multiple devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the loans and holds will be synced across these apps.</li>
<li>Bookmarks from NLB Mobile will not be seen in Libby as they are actually different features on NLB Mobile and Libby. 'Bookmarks' on NLB Mobile refer to bookmarks of favourite physical and digital items, while 'Bookmarks' on Libby refer to the bookmarking of pages or timestamps within the digital items.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Libby versus OverDrive</h2>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc5">
        <label for="acc5">What is the difference between NLB Mobile and Libby?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>NLB Mobile and Libby are apps that let you borrow and read NLB's eBooks / eAudiobooks.</p>
<p><strong>NLB Mobile</strong> is an NLB app designed for access and transactions. It lets you borrow and read or listen to eBooks / eAudiobooks online, but does not have a built-in reader for downloaded eBooks / eAudiobooks. Additionally, it lets you access eNewspapers / eMagazines as well as online courses, and check your library account.</p>
<p><strong>Libby </strong>is a third-party app by OverDrive. It also lets you borrow and download NLB's eBooks / eAudiobooks, but with a simpler user interface. <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/6103.htm?tocpath=Home%7CGetting%20started%7C_____2">Watch a short introduction video on how to set up Libby</a>.</p>

		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc6">
        <label for="acc6">Why does NLB Mobile ask me to install Libby when I choose to download an eBook / eAudiobook?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>NLB Mobile is designed for access and transactions. It lets you borrow and read or listen to eBooks / eAudiobooks online, but does not have a built-in reader for downloaded eBooks / eAudiobooks. You will be prompted to install Libby as it is designed to deliver the optimal experience for reading downloaded eBooks.

        <label for="acc7">I still prefer OverDrive to Libby. How can I continue to use OverDrive to download eBooks and eAudiobooks?  </label>
        <div class="acc-body">
    <p><ol><li>Launch OverDrive.</li>
    <li>Go to the OverDrive app menu and select "National Library Board Singapore".</li>
    <li>Log in using your myLibrary ID.</li>

  <h2>Skip the Line</h2>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc13">
        <label for="acc13">I saw a category called “Skip the Line” in Libby. What is it?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>“Skip the Line” is a feature that allows you to borrow popular digital titles immediately, instead of joining a long reservations list. “Skip the Line” copies have special rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike other copies which you can borrow for 21 days, “Skip the Line” copies expire after only seven days. This is to allow more people to access these popular books.</li>
	<li>You can only borrow <b>one</b> “Skip the Line” title at any one time, regardless of how many eBooks / eAudiobooks you currently have on loan. To borrow another “Skip the Line” title, you must first return your “Skip the Line” copy. To return it, select "Shelf" at the bottom right of the screen. Then, tap on the square icon next to your title and select "Return Early".
  </li>
  <li>You cannot renew a “Skip the Line” loan.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc14">
        <label for="acc14">How do I know if a title I want to borrow has “Skip the Line” copies?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">

        <label for="acc15">Where can I browse a list of all “Skip the Line” titles?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>It’s simple! Launch Libby. Tap on the “Library” tab at the bottom, then select “Explore”. Select 
“Skip the Line”. Check back often as the list changes frequently.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc16">
        <label for="acc16">I saw that a book I have already reserved has a “Skip the Line” copy. Can I still borrow a “Skip the Line” copy?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>Yes, you can! A “Skip the Line” loan will not affect your reservation.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc17">
        <label for="acc17">Does my “Skip the Line” loan contribute to my eBook loan quota (i.e. 16
eBooks / eAudiobooks)?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
  <p>Yes. In addition, do note that you can only borrow one “Skip the Line” title at a time, regardless of how many 
eBooks / eAudiobooks you currently have on loan.</p>

		<input type="radio" name="acc" id="acc9">
        <label for="acc9">Can I read NLB's eBooks using Kindle / Kobo / Nook / Apple Books / Google Play Books / Adobe Digital Editions?</label>
        <div class="acc-body">
<p>Format availability for eBooks is subject to the negotiations between OverDrive and the respective companies, e.g. Amazon. NLB will purchase eBooks in the best formats that are available in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kindle</strong>: Currently, Kindle is not supported but do check this page again for updates.</p>
		<p><strong>Kobo</strong>: Yes, you can access NLB's eBooks <b>directly</b>, if you have any of the following models:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kobo Libra H2O,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Forma,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Aura ONE,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Aura Edition 2,</li>
  <li>Aura H2O Edition 2, or&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Clara HD devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Log in with your myLibrary ID via the OverDrive integration under Settings &gt; &nbsp;OverDrive on these Kobo devices to read NLB's eBooks. Titles do not need to be available in Kobo format to be downloaded on a Kobo device. However, only NLB eBooks which are found in the Kobo store can be borrowed directly from these Kobo devices. 
  <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/2194.htm">Read this article</a> for a step-by-step guide on how to borrow OverDrive ebooks on your Kobo device.
</p>
<p>For older models of Kobo eReaders such as those below, you will need to transfer NLB's eBooks from a computer using the free Adobe Digital Editions software:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kobo Aura</li>
  <li>Touch 2.0</li>
  <li>Glo</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the steps to do so:</p>
<p>i. Connect your eReader to your computer</p>
<p>ii. Install and authorise Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) on your computer</p>
<p>iii. Download an EPUB or PDF eBook to ADE from your library’s digital collection. Downloaded eBooks should open automatically in ADE.</p>
<p>iv. In ADE, make sure you’re in the “Library” view. Your eReader should show up under “Devices”. You may need to accept a file-transfer prompt in your eReader in order to appear in ADE.</p>
<p>v. If your eReader is not detected by ADE, you might have to update to the most recent version of ADE. For more information, read this article on 
  <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0047.html">what to do if your eReader is not detected by ADE</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Nook</strong>: NLB currently does not purchase and support eBooks in the Nook format as it is not officially available to the Singapore market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apple Books</strong>: Currently, Apple Books is not supported but do check this page again for updates.</p>
<p><strong>Google Play Books</strong>: Currently, Google Play Books is not supported but do check this page again for updates.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Digital Editions</strong>: Yes, you can. Read this article on
