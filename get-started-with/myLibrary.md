 <p>Not yet a library member? Sign up <a href="https://account.nlb.gov.sg">online</a> or at our libraries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are already a library member, <a href="https://account.nlb.gov.sg">create a myLibrary ID</a> (user ID) to check your library account online, read eBooks and access all the resources in our digital collection.</p>
<h2>Sign Up for Library Membership Online</h2>
<p></p>

<button class="accordion">Can I sign up for library membership online?</button>

<div class="panel">
  <div class="libby">
    <p>Yes, you can sign up <a href="https://account.nlb.gov.sg">online</a> if you meet all the criteria below:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are a Singaporean or Permanent Resident (PR)</li>
<li>You have a SingPass login ID and password</li>
</ul>
<p>Do note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are a Singaporean/PR who recently signed up to be a new PAssion card member, you do not have to sign up for library membership online (see related question below).</li>
<li>If you are a PR and a student at an MOE school, you are eligible for a waiver on the one-time registration fee. To receive the waiver, sign up for library membership at the libraries instead of online.</li>
</ul>
      </p></div>

</div>

<button class="accordion">Can I read local newspapers published by Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) such as <i>The Straits Times, Business Times</i> and <i>Lianhe Zaobao</i> on PressReader?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <div class="libby">
  <p>Yes, you can. But it is important to note that you are only able to read SPH newspapers <u>onsite</u> at NLB&rsquo;s libraries via:</p>
<ul>
<li>The libraries&rsquo; computers
<ul>
<li>eNewspaper Stations (using PressReader Windows app)</li>
<li>Multimedia stations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your device, <u>only</u> while it is connected to NLB's Wireless@SG/SGx networks
<ul>
<li>PressReader app (Android, iOS and Windows)</li>
<li>NLB Mobile app via the eNewspapers &amp; eMagazines icon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download SPH newspapers to your personal device and continue to read the downloaded content even when you are away from the library premises. You can download as many SPH newspapers as you want when you are at the libraries just as long as your device has enough storage for the downloaded content!</p>
<p>SPH newspapers are not available <u>outside of NLB library premises</u> in Singapore due to the geographic restriction set by the publisher.</p></div>
</div>

<button class="accordion">When I open the PressReader app, I see a box that says ‘Sponsored Access’. What does “Sponsored Access” mean?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <div class="libby">
  <p>You will be granted NLB’s PressReader ‘Sponsored Access’ if you connect your device to Wireless@SG/SGx at the libraries via the PressReader app or online at PressReader.com. You will also be granted this when you tap on the 'eNewspapers & eMagazines' icon in the NLB Mobile app.</p>
<p>With ‘Sponsored Access’ activated, you will be able to access and download PressReader content for an extended period <u>even after leaving the library</u> premises. You can continue to read the content that you have downloaded on the mobile app until you decide to delete the files.</p></div>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Where can I get the PressReader app?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <div class="libby">
 <p>Currently, you can download the app on iOS and Android devices for free at the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pressreader-news-magazines/id313904711?mt=8">Apple app store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newspaperdirect.pressreader.android&amp;hl=en">Google Play Store</a>.</p>
